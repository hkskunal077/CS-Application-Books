These all will be usefull for anyone, engineer or researcher. Also try to concentrate on one particular topic and get an expert in it first, it will be much easier to accomplish and will open you opportunities right away. Don't try to become an expert in everything and also do not neglect "not prestigious" experience. Any experience is very valuable.
